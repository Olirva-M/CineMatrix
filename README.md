# CineMatrix
Movie Scheduler for a Multiplex Mall

## Project Overview:
The analysis of qualitative data is challenging and often frustrating. The popularity of movies has to be known and then appropriately scheduled. Keeping in mind the difficulties faced in manually carrying out this process, a movie scheduling software is developed. 
CineMatrix is a project developed in the C programming language to create and manage a 3-day movie schedule for a multiplex mall. The purpose of this project is to automate the process of scheduling movies, assigning showtimes, and managing seat availability for a multiplex cinema located in a mall. This software application streamlines the management of movie screenings, crowd, and optimizes the overall operational efficiency of the multiplex.

## Technical Details:
- Programming Language: The project is built using the C programming language, known for its efficiency and ability to handle low-level operations.
- Data Structures: The project employs various data structures such as arrays, and structures to manage movie data.
- User Interface: The user interfaces are implemented using text-based menus and prompts in the terminal.

## Installation and Setup
1. Ensure that you have a C compiler. If not, download MinGW - Minimalist GNU for Windows from the official website. 
2. The commands to compile and execute the program are:
